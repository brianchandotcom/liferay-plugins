javax.portlet.description.1_WAR_securitymanagerportlet=Java Security Manager is used to protect the portal and host system from unwanted side effects and malicious software introduced by plugins. It controls a plugin's access by requiring that it specifies ahead of time the portal resources it intends to access. Potentially unsafe API access attempts are checked against the security manager properties specified in it's liferay-plugin-package.properties file. The Java Security Manager is defaulted to be enabled if security-manager-enabled is set true in a plugin. When enabled, performance may be adversely affected depending on how long it takes to check certain permissions and how frequently it is required. It is recommended that the necessary performance tests are done before enabling it on a production environment.
